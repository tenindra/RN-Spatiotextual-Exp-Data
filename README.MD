# Spatio-Textual Dataset for Points-of-Interest (POIs) in the United States

This repository contains a dataset with POI information for the United States created by extracting data from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) ([Â© OpenStreetMap contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)). This dataset was used to experimentally evaluate spatio-textual query techniques and is made available to the research community. If you use the dataset, please cite our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8620331) if you can. 

## Instructions

Each line in the dataset represents a POI with the first column representing longitude (x-value), second column representing latitude (y-value) and the final column being a list of comma-separated textual phrases associated with the POI (e.g., category, name, etc).
